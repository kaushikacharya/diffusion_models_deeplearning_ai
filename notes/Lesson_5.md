# Controlling

- Embedding vector captures meaning

## Context

- Context is a vector for controlling generation.
- Context can be text embeddings, e.g. > 1000 in length.
- Context can also be categories, e.g. 5 in length.
  - KA: This would look like one-hot encoding.

## Notebook

- [Jupyter Notebook](../code/L3_Context.ipynb)
